# AudioStreamer
I am planning to write a simple app to capture the audio from one computer and
stream it to another computer to be played. My use case is very simple: I have
a desktop PC hooked up to speakers and a laptop on the other side of the room,
and I'd like to be able to control what plays on the speakers using my laptop.
There is probably some existing program that I could use to accomplish this
task, but I thought it would be a fun little programming project.
